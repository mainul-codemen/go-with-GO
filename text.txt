Before we look at files, we need to understand Go’s io package. The io package con‐
sists of a few functions, but mostly interfaces used in other packages. The two main
interfaces are Reader and Writer . Reader s support reading via the Read method.
Writer s support writing via the Write method. Many functions in Go take Reader s or
Writer s as arguments.
